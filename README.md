# brume

I am not a designer so I cannot impress you with breathtaking Jekyll themes, but brume is something that just came to my mind and I had to build it. It is a clean and simple theme, which has an about page and an archive page that lists all your blog posts. brume uses redcarpet as the Markdown processor with strikethrough extension enabled by default (so you can use ~~ to strike out words).

This is how the "Home" page looks like.

And this is a single post.

## Usage

To use brume, download the ZIP file and extract it's contents. Open up *_config.yml* file and fill in values for author (your name), description (blog description) and url (blog url). You should also edit the About page content in *about/index.md*. If you want to remove or add additional links in the navigation menu, it can be done using the *_config.yml* file as well.
