# brume

I am not a designer so I cannot impress you with breathtaking Jekyll themes, but brume is something that just came to my mind and I had to build it. It is a clean and simple theme, which has an about page and an archive page that lists all your blog posts. brume uses redcarpet as the Markdown processor with strikethrough extension enabled by default (so you can use ~~ to strike out words).

This is how the "Home" page looks like.

And this is a single post.

## Usage

- Download the ZIP file and extract it's contents.
- Open *_config.yml* file and enter your site's URL and add additional configuration or update the existing one if needed.
- Open *_data/brume.yml* file and fill in values for site name (site title), author (your name) and description (blog description). This file contains all the custom information about your page. You can access it using `site.data.brume` object.
- Open *about/index.md* file and add information about you or your site. You can delete this file and directory if not needed.
- Open *_data/links.yml* and add additional links or update the existing ones that you want to be displayed in the navigation menu.
- Generate your site and be happy!
